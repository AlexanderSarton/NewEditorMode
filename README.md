How to create a new editor mode and show custom variables and execute functions from a editor mode plugin

This is a kind of extension for the video created by Michael Noland from Epic Games.

This did not translate directly to an editor mode so it took me some research into the 
Landscape Editor Mode to get the tool working with custom properties and functions.

I just hope this code can help other programmers understand extending the editor better and get up to speed with it faster.

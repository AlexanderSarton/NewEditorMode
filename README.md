How to create a new editor tool and show custom variables and execute functions from a editor tool plugin

This is a kind of extension for the video created by Micheal Noland from Epic Games.

This did not translate directly to an editor tool so it took me some research into the 
Landscape Editor Tool to get the tool working with custom properties and functions.

I just hope this code can help other programmers understand extending the editor better and get up to speed with it faster.
